      <h3>About CTR</h3>
      <p>CTR Window Washing was founded by Brett Eagar and Kyle Watson in 2018. As young men, they were trained in the skills and art of window washing and have improved their methods over the past 4 years. As the business grew, they brought on additional help. The CTR crew now consists of 5 experienced washers, which allows them to keep up with their increasing demand. Besides washing windows, Brett likes to tinker with bikes and cars, and Kyle spends his time running and training for the upcoming cross country season.
